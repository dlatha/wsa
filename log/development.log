Now, I know how to do this with jquery AJAX, doing an AJAX call and passing in the path, but it doesn't seem like the Rails way.\r\n\r\nI say this because the result is that the main view does not show you the entire structure of the page. When you render a partial, you at least see the partial's positioning inside the document, if you render a partial via AJAX, you have to read the javascript code to know that it's there.\r\n\r\nIs there a more unobtrusive (for lack of a better word) way to do this?", "title"=>"Third1"}}
